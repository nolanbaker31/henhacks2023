# henhacks2023
Welcome! This is our henhacks (https://www.henhackshackathon.com/home) hackathon 2023 project.

The goal of our project was to teach students how to utilize command line tools, including bash commands, git commands & make commands.
We accomplished this by creating an interactive GUI and giving tutorials on commands, as well as quizzes.

Installation and use of our program:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 gui.py
```
