Section 7: Makefiles

When building projects, the makefile is a useful tool.

In a makefile, each unindented line represents a target followed by dependencies:

targets: dependencies
	recipe

when the command "make target" is run in the parent directory of the makefile, it will use the makefiles recipe to build target.
Here is an example recipe to compile a c program:

main.o: main.c main.h
	gcc main.c -o main.o

Makefile targets can also be used to execute commands:

clean:
	rm -f *.o

When "make clean" is run in the parent directory, it will use the makefile clean target and remove all files ending in .o

Makefile targets can also call other to be built:

all: main.o second.o

When "make all" is executed, it will look for recipes for main.o and second.o and make these.
