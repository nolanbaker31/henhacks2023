Section 3: Piping and Stream Editing
One of the most useful features in bash for scripts and commands is the many ways to link multiple commands together using different operators and commands.

Here are some common ways to chain commands together:
  cat file.txt | echo           -- the | represents pipe, sending output of first command to input of second
  echo "new text" > file.txt    -- the > is a redirection, overwriting file.txt with output of the first command
  echo "both text" >> file.txt  -- The >> is a redirection with noclobber, appending first command output to file.txt

 Here are some useful commands for modifying text streams:
   grep [options] Patterns <file>  -- grep searches for patterns in each <file>, prints corresponding lines. grep has many options and can use regular expressions for patterns. Read the man page for more info.
   head <file>    -- print the top 10 lines of each file, use -n flag to set number of lines or -c to use bytes.
   tail <file>    -- similar to head, but print last lines of the file.

For more advanced options, read man pages for sed, a stream editor, and awk, a pattern scanning and processing language.
