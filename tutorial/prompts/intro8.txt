Section 6: Git Basics
git is a project contect tracker incredibly useful for organizing work especially with a team.
Project changes are tracked as commits and stored in a remote repository.
Checkout https://github.com/ for a remote repository.

Essential github workflow is:
1. Start or clone a repo to your local disk
2. Make changes, add features locally
3. add these changes to be staged
4. commit the staged changes, including a commit message to explain the changes
5. push the commit to the remote repository
6. As necessary, pull any changes from the remote repository

Essential commands are:
 git init          -- initialize a repository in current directory
 git clone <url>   -- clone an existing repo into current directory
 git add <files>   -- add modified files to stage for commit
 git commit -m ""  -- create new commit with changes, tagged with message
 git push          -- push commits to remote origin repo
 git pull          -- pull new commits from remote repo that are not present locally

To make it easier to develop new features without affecting the working code while in development, git allows the use of branches to keep code seperate.

git checkout <branch> -- switch to existing branch
git branch            -- show git branches
git checkout -b <branch> -- create and switch to new branch
