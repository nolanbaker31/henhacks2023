Section 5: Networking
The Linux CLI offers many ways to use networking capabilities.

Some examples are:
  ping [options] <address>   -- send packets to an IP address or website
  ssh [options] dst          -- open an OpenSSH remote client to dst
  scp user@src:path dst      -- copy files over ssh, from src to dst
