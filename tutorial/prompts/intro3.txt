Section 1: Navigation

In the Linux OS, all data, processes, programs, etc. are stored as files within a directory tree.

A few important notes about directory syntax:
- to reference the current users home directory:
	~/
- to reference the current working direcory:
	./
- to reference the parent directory of current working directory:
    ../

A few important directory navigation commands:
- To print the current working directory, use the 'pwd' command.
- To list files in the current directory or specified path, use the 'ls' command.
Make sure to read the man page for this command as there are many valuable options.
One such flag is '-a', which tells ls to show all files, including
hidden files (beginning with '.').
	ls -a 			-- print all files within current directory
	ls ~/           -- print all files within uers home directory
	la -l           -- print file ownership information and metadata
- To change directory, use the 'cd' command.
	cd Documents    -- change to Documents directory within currnet working directory
	cd ~/           -- change to home directory
	cd -            -- change to previous working directory
	cd ..           -- change to parent directory

Another useful tool is aliasing. You can alias commands or file paths to make often used
commands easier.
	alias                -- list curently defined aliases
	alias la='ls -lA'    -- la will now run 'ls -lA' in current directory
	unalias la           -- removes alias for la
