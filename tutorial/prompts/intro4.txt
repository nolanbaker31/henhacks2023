Section 2: File Management
Interacting with files is one of the main applications of the Linux CLI.
Don't forget to read the man pages for more command options!

Some common commands are:
	touch <filename>     -- update time metadate of a file, or create a file if none exists
	mv <src> <dst>       -- move file <src> to <dst>, can be different directory or just renaming
	cp <src> <dst>       -- copy file from <src> to <dst>, use -R to recursively copy all files in the directory
	rm <file>            -- remove/delete a file listing, use -R to recursively delete subfolder and files or -f to force
	(CAUTION- the rm command can cause loss of important data, only use with safe user priveledges)
	mkdir <dir>          -- creates a new directory <dir> in current directory
	rmdir <dir>          -- remove/delete directory <dir>

Some commands to interract/read file data:
	cat <file1...>       -- prints contents of file to CLI, can concatenate multiple files. See next section for more usage with this command
	tac <file1...>       -- similar to cat, but prints file in reverse
	find <src> <xpr>     -- Find filename with <xpr> starting from <src> directory
	diff <file> <file>   -- compare files line by line
	tar                  -- archive utility, see man page for usage and options
