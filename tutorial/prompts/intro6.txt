Section 4: Permissions & Users
In Linux OS, the user interacts with the system with a user account. These accounts have different groups they belong to with different permissions. Files have metadata that determine who has what kind of access to the file.

This metadata can be represented as a string of characters:

rwxrwxrw-      -- r-read, w-write, x-execute, in order of Owner:Group:Other

or a three digit number:

776            -- (4*r) + (2*w) + (1*x) for each Owner:Group:Other

Owner is usually the creator of file or owner of the system. Group is the group owning the file. Others is for anyone not in these two groups.

To see this metadata, remember the to check out the flags for the ls command.

To modify this metadata, use the commands:
  chmod <expr> <file> -- apply <expr> permissions (such as 774) to <file>
  chmod +x <file>     -- useful to make file executable
  chown [Owner][:[Group]] <file>   -- change file owner and group
