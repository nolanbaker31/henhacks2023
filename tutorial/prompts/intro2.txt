In the Linux CLI, commands are formatted vaguely as follows:
	command [OPTION..] <parameter>
Where command is the command to execute (from your PATH), flags are
optional flags from the command's man page, and <parameter> is the
argument passed to the command. Flags are usually denoted as such: '-a'

To get help with command usage and see optional flags, check the man pages for the command:
	man <command>
For instance, to find more information on the list command and its options use:
	man ls

To search for a command by searching the command pages, use apropos:
	apropos [option..] <keyword>
For instance, to find commands dealing with file compression use:
	apropos compress

Some important commands to interact and send signals to the currently running process are as follows:
- Ctrl+C : terminate running process by sending SIGINT
- Ctrl+Z : send SIGSTP to halt current foreground process, resume with fg

To run multiple seperate commands, seperate with ';'.
To run a second command on success of the first, use '&&'
